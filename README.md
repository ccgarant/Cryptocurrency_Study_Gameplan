## Wallet Basics
- What is a 'wallet'?
    - Think of your real wallet which keeps your cash and credit cards, however this is a digital wallet that maintains your digital assests.  
    - The digital wallet really maintains your public and private keys, and allows you to interact with blockchains.
    
- Different types of wallets
    - hot wallets - online
        - exchanges (coinbase, kraken, binance)
        - online wallets (blockchain, mew)
        - software wallets (exodus, ledger, electrum)
    - cold wallets - offline (safest)
        - hardware wallets (ledger, trezor)
        - paper wallets (written down)
        
- What is a hardware 'wallet'?
    - A secure hardware device used to store your cryptocurrency (really private keys).
    - Considered to be 'cold storage', the safest option. 
    - The main principle behind hardware wallets is to provide full isolation between the private keys and your easy-to-hack computer or smartphone.
    
- Security Basics
    - public and private keys
        - Think of a public key as your email address, and your private key as the password.  Obviously, you wouldn't want to reveal your password.
        - [What are Public Keys and Private Keys (Ledger)](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-are-public-keys-and-private-keys)
    - backup recovery seed phrase
        - If you lose your private keys, your recovery phrase is your last line of defense to recover your digital assests.  Obviously, this should be kept secret.
     - If your software or hardware wallet is lost or destroyed, you can get a new one, and 'restore' your digital assests with your private and recovery seed phrase (assuming you have these safely stored separately).  After all, the assets still exist in the blockchain, you just need to claim them.  This is not so obvious at first, and an early concern of mine.

## Bitcoin
- Originally meant for a decentralized electronic peer-to-peer eCash system, but now regarded and treated as digital gold.
- [Whitepaper - Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
    > "Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
    payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
    financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
    benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
    We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
    The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
    hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
    the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
    events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
    long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
    attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
    network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
    basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
    proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."

## Ethereum
- Think bitcoin, but with a smart programmable blockchain to build 'smart contracts' or 'decentralized applications'.
- [How Ethereum works (Ethereum.org)](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/#how-ethereum-works)
    - [How does Ethereum work, anyway? By: Preethi Kasireddy](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369)
    - [A gentle introduction to Ethereum By: Anthony Lewis](https://bitsonblocks.net/2016/10/02/gentle-introduction-ethereum/)
    - [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)
        > "The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic "boxes" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state."
