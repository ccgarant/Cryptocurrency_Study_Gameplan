## Wallet Basics
- What is a 'wallet'?
    - Think of your real wallet which keeps your cash and credit cards, however this is a digital wallet that maintains your digital assests.  
    - The digital wallet really maintains your public and private keys, and allows you to interact with blockchains.
    
- Different types of wallets
    - hot wallets - online
        - exchanges (coinbase, kraken, binance)
        - online wallets (blockchain, mew)
        - software wallets (exodus, ledger, electrum)
    - cold wallets - offline (safest)
        - hardware wallets (ledger, trezor)
        - paper wallets (written down)
        
- What is a hardware 'wallet'?
    - A secure hardware device used to store your cryptocurrency (really private keys).
    - Considered to be 'cold storage', the safest option. 
    - The main principle behind hardware wallets is to provide full isolation between the private keys and your easy-to-hack computer or smartphone.
    
- Security Basics
    - public and private keys
        - Think of a public key as your email address, and your private key as the password.  Obviously, you wouldn't want to reveal your password.
        - [What are Public Keys and Private Keys](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-are-public-keys-and-private-keys)
    - backup recovery seed phrase
        - If you lose your private keys, your recovery phrase is your last line of defense to recover your digital assests.  Obviously, this should be kept secret.
     - If your software or hardware wallet is lost or destroyed, you can get a new one, and 'restore' your digital assests with your private and recovery seed phrase (assuming you have these safely stored separately).  After all, the assets still exist in the blockchain, you just need to claim them.  This is not so obvious at first, and an early concern of mine.
